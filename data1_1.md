{(aim|}
This aim of this visualisation shows the object is a teddy bear. This is achieved by showing the areas of highest density change as an iso surface, these areas are the teddyâ€™s eyes and nose as they are likely made out of a tougher material e.g. plastic. The visualisation also shows the teddy bear has a slightly denser chest area that appears to be in a rectangle, this is likely some sort of label, message etc.

{(vistype|}
The threshold visualisation function was used in this mapping with the minimum value set to 44 and the max set to 1462.

{(vismapping|}
For visual mappings I decided to use an isosurface, I then created a subset of the data and use this going forward in my visualisations, I selected the following data points for each axis, X: 20 -> 440, Y: 80 -> 430, Z: Unchanged. This helped to cut out some of the additional noise from the dataset so I could focus purely on the object in question. This had the added benefit of reducing processing time as a lot of the denser data points are behind the teddy.
.
I used the 'jet' transfer function to show the gradient changes and color

{(dataprep|}
For data preparation I also used the transform function to increase the size of the Z axis by 10 times. This helped to make the teddy seem normally proportioned and not squashed.

{(limitations|}
The visualisation only shows one iso surface as is a single threshold value so provides no insight as to what is inside the object.
